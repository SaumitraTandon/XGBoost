# XGBoost Classification

This repository contains an implementation of the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm for binary classification tasks. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning technique that combines the strengths of decision trees and gradient boosting to achieve high predictive accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is `Data.csv`, which contains numerical features and a binary target variable. The dataset should be placed in the same directory as the Python script.

## Code

The Python script `xgboost_classification.py` includes the following steps:

1. **Data Import**: The dataset is imported from the `Data.csv` file using pandas.
2. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).
3. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is further split into training and testing sets using `sklearn`'s `train_test_split` function.
4. **Model Training**: An XGBoost classifier is instantiated and trained on the training set using the `fit` method.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the confusion matrix and accuracy score are calculated.
6. **Cross-Validation**: The script also performs 10-fold cross-validation on the training set to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

You can install these libraries using pip:
## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `Data.csv` dataset file in the same directory as the `xgboost_classification.py` script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:
5. The script will output the confusion matrix, accuracy score, mean cross-validation accuracy, and standard deviation of the cross-validation scores.
